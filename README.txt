Quick Readme for Installation of the Google Chrome Extension. 

1)Launch the Google Chrome browser and navigate to Tools -> Extensions

2)Check the checkbox for Developer mode and click "Load unpacked extension.."

3)Load extension from this directory: N:\_USERS\Joseph.Saunderson\Google Extensions\EmailTemplates
If you wish to keep it locally you can copy the directory onto your workstation and set the path accordingly

4)Add a test email template and then restart the Chrome Browser. this will finalize installation

PLEASE NOTE: if the extension is deleted from Chrome this will DELETE the Database that was created. If you need to get the most up to date version of the extension you can just use the reload option if you are pointing to the directory on my user folder. If you wish to back up your database you may find it at the following path on your workstation(directory may vary between workstations):

C:\Users\XXX_USERNAME_XXX\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\databases\chrome-extension_XXXXXXXXX

If you have trouble locating the database please see me and I'll assist you. I'll be making a feature in the future for backing up the Database.

N.B. If the email templates are not pasting into the textbox, try refreshing your current page and that should resolve the issue. For auto-naming and date, use the formats "_FNAME_", "_LNAME_", "_DATE_"
